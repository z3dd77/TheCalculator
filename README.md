# TheCalculator

This calculator application was crafted while drawing inspiration from a YouTube tutorial. While following the tutorial's guidance, I've added unique elements to personalize the application.

The calculator boasts a user-friendly interface, where each button responds to user input with precision. It handles numerical input, decimal points, and sign changes gracefully.

One highlight of this calculator is its ability to perform arithmetic operations with ease. Users can select addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division through dedicated buttons. The "equals" button triggers the selected operation, displaying results in real-time.

A "Clear" button resets the calculator, clearing both the display and operator label. Additionally, there's a button for toggling the sign of numbers.

In conclusion, this calculator combines tutorial-based development with personal enhancements, offering a refined and user-friendly tool for precise calculations. Its design and functionality strike a balance between art and science, catering to users seeking both precision and elegance in their computations.
